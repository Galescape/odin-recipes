First project assignment from TOP
This project is mye first project assignment from TOP. 

In this project I will demonstrate what skills I have learned so far. These skills include: setting up a basic HTML document, integrate absolute and relative links, add images, make ordered and unordered lists, play around with certain attributes like bold and emphasis, probably some HTML entities, staging and committing with Git. I will update this if I remember anything I might have missed.
